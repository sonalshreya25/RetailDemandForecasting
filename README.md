# RetailDemandForecasting
## Overview
### The project leverages Walmartâ€™s retail sales dataset to develop a robust Demand Forecasting System aimed at addressing challenges in inventory management and supply chain efficiency. Walmart, as one of the largest retail chains in the world, generates vast amounts of transactional data that reflect purchase patterns influenced by factors like seasonality, regional trends, promotions, and customer preferences. By utilizing this rich dataset, the project aims to create a predictive model that helps optimize inventory levels and improve procurement processes.
## Key Objectives
### **Accurate Purchase Forecasting**
### Develop a robust predictive model to forecast future purchase values based on historical trends and other influential factors.
### **Optimizing Inventory Levels**
### Leverage purchase forecasts to recommend optimal inventory levels, minimizing risks of overstocking or understocking and ensuring better resource utilization.
### **Enhancing Supply Chain Efficiency**
### Enable data-driven procurement and inventory management by aligning purchase predictions with supply chain operations, ensuring seamless stock replenishment and improved cost-efficiency.
### **Improved Customer Satisfaction**
### Use the forecasting model to maintain adequate stock levels, reducing the chances of order delays or unavailability, thereby enhancing the customer experience.
